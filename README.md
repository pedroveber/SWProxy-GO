# SWProxy-GO

## Deprecated repo

This project is no longer updated anymore because I feel this game less
attractive to me now.

## Intro

This is an evil project which has been against my initial proposal as to just
collect monster, rune and drop information of Summoners War. Anyway, I have
drawn the line that never affect the other players.

Please use this proxy after your **careful consideration**.

## How to use

 - Make sure you have installed [go](https://golang.org/) environment
 - `go get -u github.com/crayontxx/swproxy-go/proxy`
 - `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/crayontxx/swproxy-go/proxy`
 - `go run proxy.go`
 - You can change the setting in `config.cfg` before running the proxy
 - Make your device's http proxy point to the proxy
 - Enjoy
