# SWProxy-GO

This is an evil project which has been against my initial proposal as to just
collect monster, rune and drop information of Summoners War.

Please use this proxy after your **careful consideration**.

Since early Dec 2016, Com2Us has been using HTTPS protocol within this game.
Luckily, the initial request is still via HTTP, which allows us to continue 
using HTTP in the following requests. However, AFAIK, Apple will force all of 
the applications on App Store to apply HTTPS since Jan 2017, I have no idea if 
this project can still work at that time. We will see.
